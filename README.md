# Height Distribution Analysis

This project analyzes the **height distribution** of two synthetic groups (A and B) based on normal distributions.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

- **Group A:** Heights follow a normal distribution with a mean of 175 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm.
- **Group B:** Heights follow a normal distribution with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 15 cm.

We randomly generate 100 height values for each group and analyze:

- Mean and standard deviation
- Boxplots to visualize spread and outliers
- Which group has greater variability?

---

## 📎 Objectives

- Generate height data for each group
- Calculate:
  - Mean
  - Standard Deviation
  - variance
  - Range
  - Interquartile Range
  - Coefficient of Variation
- Plot boxplots
- Interpret the results
